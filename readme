# LlamaSim Prototype

This repo hosts the static LlamaSim prototype.

## GitHub Pages

The site is deployed via GitHub Actions whenever changes land on `main`.

### Enable Pages

1. Go to **Settings → Pages** in the GitHub repo.
2. Under **Build and deployment**, set **Source** to **GitHub Actions**.
3. Push to `main` (or trigger the workflow manually) and your site will publish.

The workflow lives at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` and ships the root of the
repository as the Pages artifact.
